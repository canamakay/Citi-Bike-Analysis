# Citi-Bike-Analysis

# About Citi Bike
Citi Bike is New York’s bike share system.  Launched in May 2013, it consists of bikes locked into docking stations throughout the city.  Bikes are borrowed from one station and can be returned to any other docking station in the system.  Since its launch it has become an important part of transportation in the city, getting people to and from work, school, appointments, and social engagements.  

# Objective 
The goal of this project is to gather insights about rider behavior to help inform marketing strategies and expansion of Citi Bike services.

# Data 
The data set was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanmcummings/citi-bike-data)
