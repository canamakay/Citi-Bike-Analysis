# Citi Bike Analysis

# Project Overview
Citi Bike is New York’s bike share system.  Launched in May 2013, it consists of bikes locked into docking stations throughout the city.  Bikes are borrowed from one station and can be returned to any other docking station in the system.  Since its launch it has become an important part of transportation in the city, getting people to and from work, school, appointments, and social engagements.  The goal of this project is to gather insights about rider behavior to help inform marketing strategies and expansion of Citi Bike services.

# Key Questions 
- What are the busiest days and hours for Citi Bikers? 
- How does rider behavior differ based on gender?  
-	How does rider behavior differ based on age group? 
-	How does rider behavior differ based on subscriber status?
-	Does trip duration vary among days?
-	Does trip duration vary among genders?
-	Does trip duration vary among subscriber statuses?
- How does age affect trip duration?
